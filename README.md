# Softmax-regression-in-Tensorflow
The code is written by Chuong Nguyen.
It aims to read csv file and train the data by Softmax regression in Tensorflow.
It is necessary in the case that one have a csv file of data and try to training them with Softmax regression. 
Specifically, I consider the example of reading data that illustrates the grades of students based on their study and attendance time.
This code I design is to predict the score of students given their spending time on learning and attending the class.
