# Softmax-regression-in-Tensorflow
The code is aimed to read csv file and train the data by Softmax regression in Tensorflow.
It is necessary in the case that one have a csv file of data and try to training them with Softmax regression. 
Specifically, I consider the example of reading data that illustrate the grade of students based on their study and attendance time
This code I design is to predict the score of students given their spending time for learning and attending the class.
